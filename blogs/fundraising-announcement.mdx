Today is a significant milestone for us as we proudly announce that we have raised over $13 million in funding to drive the future of distributed tracing and observability.

Founded in 2023, Odigos was built with a mission to simplify the complexities of distributed tracing, making it accessible and efficient for developers everywhere. Mango Capital was the first to believe in our vision, and we are extremely grateful for their support in helping us take those initial steps and lay the foundation for the platform’s success.

This latest funding round, led by Venture Guides with participation from Salesforce Ventures, Mango Capital, and Firestreak Ventures, marks a pivotal moment in our journey. We are also honored to have the backing of industry pioneers like Y Combinator, Martin Mao of Chronosphere, Christine Yen of Honeycomb, Ben Sigelman of Lightstep and Yuri Shkuro of Meta.

As we continue to grow, this new funding will fuel our efforts to expand product development and customer reach, empowering more organizations to gain deeper insights into their applications with minimal friction.

Our founders, Ari Recht and Eden Federman, bring decades of experience in the tech industry. Ari’s leadership across various high-tech sectors and Eden’s pioneering work in eBPF and OpenTelemetry have shaped Odigos into the innovative force it is today.

Our platform leverages eBPF-a cutting-edge kernel-level technology-to automate the implementation of distributed tracing, eliminating the need for code changes and ensuring zero performance overhead. By integrating seamlessly with OpenTelemetry, we enable our customers to achieve complete observability with any tool of their choice.

Stay tuned as we continue our mission to bring distributed tracing to the masses, enabling deeper visibility across every layer of your tech stack-even in areas where it wasn’t possible before with more to come… We're redefining observability by making instrumentation a seamless part of your platform’s core. And this is just the beginning: the observability landscape is overdue for change, and we're here to drive innovation and push the boundaries of what's possible.
