We are excited to release [version v0.1.52 of Odigos](https://github.com/odigos-io/odigos). This version includes multiple bug fixes and improved performance of the automatic instrumentation of Go applications.

The new Go instrumentation is integrated into the Odiglet. For the first time additional containers are no longer deployed, as Odigos now instruments your Go applications via a daemonset. Removing the need for sidecars is a big step towards our vision of seamless automatic instrumentation. It also consumes less resources and improves the performance of the automatic instrumentation.

In previous versions of Odigos, instrumentation of a Java/Python/Node.js/.NET applications, was done via [instrumentation virtual devices](/blog/instrumentation-as-resource). With this release, we are adding support for Go applications as well.

Keyval donated the [Go automatic instrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-instrumentation) to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). This instrumentation is based on eBPF, and it is now part of the OpenTelemetry project, developed by the Go Automatic Instrumentation Special Interest Group.

We are excited to be part of this effort, and we are looking forward to working with the community to improve the Go automatic instrumentation even further.

We invite you to try out Odigos, and let us know what you think. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://docs.odigos.io/installation/) or you can join our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/odigos/shared_invite/zt-1d7egaz29-Rwv2T8kyzc3mWP8qKobz~A) for assistance and feedback.
