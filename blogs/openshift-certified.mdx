Odigos is now available as Red Hat Certified Software!

Starting with version 1.0.146, you can now install Odigos on OpenShift using certified Red Hat container images. These images are based on [Red Hat's Universal Base Image (UBI)](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/base-images) and have been verified to comply with Red Hat's [software certification requirements for container images](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_software_certification/2024/).

These images are available on the [Red Hat Software Catalog](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/container-stacks/detail/675201b3ade18c062e2efc0b).

To install the certified version of Odigos, simply run `odigos install --openshift`.

This command installs Odigos with component images from `registry.connect.redhat.com/odigos` instead of the usual `docker.io/keyval`. If you want to try the images out, you can instead pull the certified images from DockerHub by running `odigos install --openshift --image-prefix docker.io/keyval`.

You can verify that you are running the certified images by checking that each component's image name contains `-ubi9` (meaning the image was built with UBI version 9).

We are proud of this achievement and hope that it will further enable teams to take advantage of the fully automatic distributed tracing provided by Odigos in a secure, reliable environment.
