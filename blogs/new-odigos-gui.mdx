We’re thrilled to unveil the public beta of our new Odigos user interface! This release marks a major step forward, bringing a fresh, intuitive design and powerful features to make observability smoother and more enjoyable for everyone.

### What’s New in the Odigos Beta UI?

1. **Modern, User-Friendly Design**  
   The UI now features a clean, streamlined layout for easy navigation. Everything you need-distributed traces, OpenTelemetry setup, key metrics-is just a click or two away.

2. **Enhanced Observability Features**  
   With new interactive visualizations for tracing and an upgraded metrics dashboard, you can get closer to the insights that matter, enabling faster, more informed actions.

3. **Built for Future Enterprise Capabilities**  
   This beta lays the foundation for enterprise-grade features like centralized licensing and sensor management, making it easier to scale observability across your organization.

4. **Ongoing Updates and Full Enterprise GA Soon**  
   Expect regular updates to the beta this month, each enhancing functionality. The full enterprise-grade version is on track for release in Q1, delivering robust observability for large-scale environments.

### Why a Public Beta?

We want you to experience the future of Odigos firsthand-and your feedback matters! By joining the beta, you’ll help shape the final product, allowing us to refine and optimize before the full release.
