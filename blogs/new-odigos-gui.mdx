We’re thrilled to unveil the public beta of our new Odigos user interface! This release marks a major step forward, bringing a fresh, intuitive design and powerful features to make observability smoother and more enjoyable for everyone.

### What’s New in the Odigos Beta UI?

1. **Modern, User-Friendly Design**  
   The UI now features a clean, streamlined layout for easy navigation. Everything you need—distributed traces, OpenTelemetry setup, key metrics—is just a click or two away.

2. **Enhanced Observability Features**  
   With new interactive visualizations for tracing and an upgraded metrics dashboard, you can get closer to the insights that matter, enabling faster, more informed actions.

3. **Built for Future Enterprise Capabilities**  
   This beta lays the foundation for enterprise-grade features like centralized licensing and sensor management, making it easier to scale observability across your organization.

4. **Ongoing Updates and Full Enterprise GA Soon**  
   Expect regular updates to the beta this month, each enhancing functionality. The full enterprise-grade version is on track for release in Q1, delivering robust observability for large-scale environments.

### Why a Public Beta?

We want you to experience the future of Odigos firsthand—and your feedback matters! By joining the beta, you’ll help shape the final product, allowing us to refine and optimize before the full release.
