A few months ago, we were on a call with an enterprise customer managing over 1,200 Kubernetes clusters. After we helped them generate telemetry data from all of their clusters, we ran into another big challenge, **observability management**. Every team had its own setup, and making one simple change like updating a destination, meant touching hundreds of clusters. That’s when we realized we needed a new control plane.

Our enterprise customers operate across multiple environments from on-prem Kubernetes clusters and VMs.

Each of these environments has its own Odigos installation, automatically collecting, processing, and exporting observability data with no code changes.

But as organizations scale, a new challenge appears:

**How do you manage and control observability across hundreds or thousands of distributed systems without touching each one manually?**

That’s where **Odigos Central** comes in.

### **Introducing Odigos Central**

**Odigos Central** is our new **on-premises control panel** that connects all your Odigos installations no matter where they run, all connected into **one unified UI**.

You get one UI to rule them all, see every cluster, change configs, and fix stuff fast:

- **View** all connected clusters or VMs
- **Monitor health and version status** for every connected Odigos instance
- **Enforce RBAC and granular permissions**, ensuring each team only sees and controls what they’re responsible for
- **Manage global actions** like configuring destinations across all platforms

### **Why We Built It**

When you’re running thousands of workloads, even a small configuration drift or instrumentation issue can cause massive blind spots. Teams were spending time managing the observability layer instead of actually using it.

With Odigos Central, operations teams get a bird’s-eye view of their entire observability stack from every environment without ever leaving their on-prem network. Everything is securely connected and easily manageable.

### **On-Prem by Design**

We built Odigos Central with enterprise security in mind.

It’s fully **on-prem**, meaning your observability control plane runs inside your own infrastructure **no data leaves your environment.**

Each Odigos installation connects securely to your central backend, allowing your organization to scale observability management without sacrificing compliance or data privacy.

### **A Simpler Future for Observability**

With Odigos Central, we’re taking the next step making it effortless **at scale.**

Whether you run 10 clusters or 10,000, Odigos Central helps you understand, control, and optimize your observability stack with the same simplicity and automation that made Odigos what it is today.
