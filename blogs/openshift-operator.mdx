We are happy to announce the new Odigos Operator for Red Hat OpenShift!

You can now use the operator as an alternative installation and upgrade method for Odigos. The current modes via Helm chart and CLI are still available as well.

To install Odigos via the Operator, navigate to **OperatorHub** and search for **Odigos**.

Once you have installed the Operator in your cluster, create an **Odigos** instance, making sure to fill in any options you need (such as **On Prem Token** for enterprise and check **openshiftEnabled** to use [Red Hat certified images](/blog/openshift-certified) and enable [additional settings](https://docs.odigos.io/setup/installation-options#openshift-installation) required for OpenShift.).

[Check out our documentation on installing with the operator for more details.](https://docs.odigos.io/setup/installation-options#openshift-installation)

While this operator currently only handles basic installation and upgrades for Odigos, we plan to continue developing and evolving it with richer functionality. Stay tuned for more updates!
