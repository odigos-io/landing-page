Today we are excited to announce version **v0.1.4** of Odigos, an open-source project that automatically generates distributed traces for all applications within minutes without code changes.

This version focuses on ARM Support, new destinations and stability improvements.

## ARM Support

ARM processors are becoming more and more popular and are now supported by Odigos. You can now run Odigos on the latest Macbooks, AWS Graviton, and other ARM based processors. This is a big step forward for Odigos that now supports applications written in Java, Go, Python, NodeJS and .NET on both x86-64 and ARM.

## New Destinations

Odigos now supports the following new destinations:

- **[Google Cloud Storage](https://docs.odigos.io/backends/gcs) (managed)** - Supported signals: Traces and Logs
- **[Azure Blob Storage](https://docs.odigos.io/backends/azureblob) (managed)** - Supported signals: Traces and Logs
- **[Sentry](https://docs.odigos.io/backends/sentry) (managed)** - Supported signals: Traces
- **[Elasticsearch](https://docs.odigos.io/backends/elasticsearch) (Open source)** - Supported signals: Traces and Logs

## Stability Improvements

We worked hard on improving the stability of Odigos. We listened to feedback from our community and made a lot of improvements to the stability of Odigos. Improvements include: supporting older linux kernels, avoiding windows-based nodes, better memory allocation, and more.

## How to install

The easiest way to install Odigos is to use the [Odigos Helm Chart](https://github.com/odigos-io/odigos-charts):

```bash
helm repo add odigos https://odigos-io.github.io/odigos-charts/
helm install my-odigos odigos/odigos --namespace odigos-system --create-namespace
```

For users upgrading from previous versions, make sure to run the following command before upgrading:

```bash
helm repo update
```
