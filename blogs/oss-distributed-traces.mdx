Adopting distributed tracing is a great way to improve the observability of your microservices-based applications. However, it can be a challenging task to implement distributed tracing in a production environment. In this blog post, we will show how to combine Odigos and Jaeger to make distributed tracing easy.

## Target application

We will use an application called [emojivoto](https://github.com/BuoyantIO/emojivoto). It is a simple web application that allows users to vote for their favorite emoji. The application is written in Go and uses gRPC for communication between services.

## Prerequisites

The following tools are required to run this tutorial:

- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to run a local Kubernetes cluster with Docker container nodes.
- [Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) to run commands against Kubernetes clusters.
- [Helm CLI](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to install Odigos and the observability backend using helm charts.

## Creating the Kubernetes cluster

Create a new local Kubernetes cluster, by running the following command:

```console
kind create cluster
```

## Installing Target Applications

Deploy the application using the following command:

```console
kubectl apply -k github.com/odigos-io/opentelemetry-go-instrumentation/docs/getting-started/emojivoto
```

## Installing Jaeger

We will use [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) as our distributed tracing backend. Jaeger is a popular CNCF project that provides a complete distributed tracing solution.

Install Jaeger using the following command:

```console
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odigos-io/opentelemetry-go-instrumentation/master/docs/getting-started/jaeger.yaml -n emojivoto
```

## Installing Odigos

Odigos will be used for generating and sending traces to Jaeger. Install Odigos using the following command:

```console
helm repo add odigos https://odigos-io.github.io/odigos-charts/
helm install my-odigos odigos/odigos --namespace odigos-system --create-namespace
```

After all the pods in the **odigos-system** namespace are running, open the Odigos UI by running the following command:

```console
kubectl port-forward svc/odigos-ui 3000:3000 -n odigos-system
```

And navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the UI.

## Selecting the target applications

There are two ways to select which applications Odigos should instrument:

- Opt out (recommended): Instrument everything, including every new application that will be deployed going forward. Users can still manually mark applications that should not be instrumented
- Opt In: Only instrument the applications selected manually by the user.

For this tutorial, we recommend choosing the opt out mode.

## Adding Jaeger as a backend

To add Jaeger as a backend, scroll down to the **Self-hosted** section and click on **Jaeger**.

The last step is to provide the Jaeger endpoint. If you followed the steps in this tutorial, the endpoint will be **jaeger.emojivoto:4317**.

## Viewing traces

Open the Jaeger UI by running the following command:

```console
kubectl port-forward svc/jaeger 16686:16686 -n emojivoto
```

And navigate to [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686) to access the UI.

Select one of the services from the list and click on **Find Traces**:

## Summary

In this tutorial, we showed how to combine Odigos and Jaeger to make distributed tracing easy. At Keyval, we believe that adopting distributed tracing should be easy and accessible to everyone. We are working hard to make this a reality.
