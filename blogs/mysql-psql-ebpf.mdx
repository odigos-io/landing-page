## The Visibility Gap in Database Observability

Most database monitoring tools were built for simpler three-tier architectures, where a monolithic application interacted with a single database. These tools rely on metrics and logs, which offer some visibility but fail to capture how queries behave in complex, distributed environments.

### Why Traditional Methods Fall Short

- Metrics provide an overview but lack detail – High CPU or slow query counts don’t explain why performance is degrading.
- Logs are fragmented – Query logs can show what ran but don’t correlate it with the broader transaction flow.
- Lack of Context Propagation – In distributed systems, a single database serves multiple services, making it impossible to connect queries to the broader transaction lifecycle.

So, how do we get more context about database platforms? It starts with tracing.

## Why Distributed Tracing Changes the Game

Distributed tracing adds missing context by tracking queries across services instead of treating the database as a black box. Tools like OpenTelemetry (OTel) provide a way to follow a transaction end-to-end, but they still require manual instrumentation for database queries.

### How eBPF Enhances Database Observability

This is where eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) fills the gap. It allows engineers to:

- Trace queries in real time without modifying application code.
- Capture transaction-level context at the kernel level.
- Automatically extract query execution metrics without enabling slow query logs.

Odigos is able to leverage eBPF to perform context propagation and fully trace database transactions without requiring intrusive logging or code modifications.

## Example: Tracing a Slow Checkout Transaction

### The Problem: Where Is the Latency?

A distributed e-commerce application uses PostgreSQL for order management and MySQL for inventory tracking. Customers report slow checkouts, but:

- CPU and memory usage are stable-no resource exhaustion.
- Slow query logs aren’t enabled, so no direct query insights are available.
- APM tools show high response times but can’t pinpoint where in the chain the delay occurs.

### Step 1: Capturing the Full Transaction Trace

Using eBPF and OpenTelemetry, we trace a single checkout transaction:

1. User places an order → The frontend sends a request to the checkout service.
2. Checkout service calls the payment API → Response in 10ms.
3. Checkout service queries PostgreSQL → Delay: over 250ms before the query returns.
4. Inventory service updates MySQL → Executes in 5ms, ruling out inventory DB as the bottleneck.

### Step 2: Identifying the Slow Query

eBPF captures the **exact PostgreSQL query** causing the slowdown:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?;
```

Expected execution time: **10-20ms**  
Observed execution time: **250ms under load**

### Step 3: Finding the Root Cause

eBPF reveals that:

- **Row locks are blocking the query** due to a long-running reporting job.
- **Connection pool saturation** is causing new queries to wait for connections.
- **A missing index** forces a full table scan instead of using an efficient lookup.

### Step 4: Fixing the Issue

- **Move reports to read replicas** to prevent blocking transactions.
- **Increase the connection pool size** to handle more concurrent queries.
- **Add a B-tree index on `user_id`** to eliminate full table scans.

Result: **Checkout latency drops from 250ms to 20ms.**

## Why Odigos Changes the Approach to Database Observability

Odigos solves the manual instrumentation problem by extending OpenTelemetry to automatically trace PostgreSQL and MySQL queries using eBPF.

### **Key Differences: Traditional APM vs. Odigos**

| Feature                  | Traditional APMs (Logs/Metrics) |      Odigos (eBPF \+ OTel)       |
| ------------------------ | :-----------------------------: | :------------------------------: |
| **Query Visibility**     |    Requires slow query logs     | Automatically traces all queries |
| **Performance Overhead** |        High (log-based)         |  Minimal (kernel-level tracing)  |
| **Distributed Tracing**  |         Limited context         |     Full context propagation     |
| **Setup Complexity**     | Manual instrumentation required |       Zero-code deployment       |

## Shifting From Metrics to Contextual Tracing

In distributed systems, databases no longer serve a single flow-they interact with multiple services in unpredictable ways. Traditional monitoring tools struggle because they weren't built for this complexity.

By combining eBPF and OpenTelemetry, Odigos brings full query-level visibility without code changes-enabling teams to trace performance issues across services instead of guessing.

## Bringing Full Observability to PostgreSQL and MySQL

Without query-level visibility, database slowdowns remain a mystery. Traditional monitoring solutions fall short because they lack deep query insights.

By combining Odigos with the capabilities of eBPF, and OpenTelemetry, developers can:

- Trace transactions end-to-end across microservices.
- Identify slow queries and database bottlenecks in real time.
- Fix database performance issues proactively, without modifying production code.
