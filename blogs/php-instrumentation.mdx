## üì£ Announcing PHP Zero-Code Auto-Instrumentation in Odigos

We're thrilled to announce that **Odigos now supports zero-code auto-instrumentation for PHP**, bringing seamless observability to one of the world‚Äôs most popular web programming languages! This feature is available in **both our community and enterprise versions**, making it easier than ever to understand what‚Äôs happening inside your PHP applications-without writing a single line of instrumentation code.

### üöÄ Why This Matters

PHP powers some of the most widely used websites and platforms across the internet-from WordPress and Drupal to Laravel and Symfony-based applications. However, achieving deep observability in PHP environments has historically been a challenge.

With Odigos‚Äô new support for **zero-code PHP auto-instrumentation**, you can:

- Automatically trace incoming HTTP requests
- Track performance and latency of functions
- Visualize bottlenecks in real-time
- Gain deep insights with no manual changes to your codebase

### üõ†Ô∏è Production-Ready `php-fpm` Support

We‚Äôre also introducing full support for the **`php-fpm` runtime**, which is the de-facto standard for running PHP in production. This means Odigos now works **out of the box** with the same high-performance configurations powering your staging and production workloads.

Whether you're running PHP inside containers, behind NGINX, or in traditional VM environments, Odigos provides a plug-and-play experience with reliable performance and minimal overhead.

### üåê 70+ Supported Destinations

Odigos integrates seamlessly with **70+ observability vendors and open source tools**, giving you the freedom to choose where your telemetry data goes. Send traces, metrics, and logs to popular destinations like:

- **Grafana, Prometheus, and Tempo**
- **Datadog, New Relic, and Dynatrace**
- **Jaeger, OpenSearch, and more**

All it takes is a few clicks to connect your instrumentation pipeline to your existing observability stack-no complex configuration or vendor lock-in.

### üß† Built on OpenTelemetry

At the heart of Odigos‚Äô instrumentation engine is **OpenTelemetry**, the industry standard for observability. By leveraging OpenTelemetry‚Äôs PHP instrumentation libraries and enhancing them with automatic context propagation and runtime configuration, we give you full visibility with minimal effort.

### üß™ Try It Out Today

Getting started is simple:

1. [Install Odigos](https://docs.odigos.io/setup/installation)
2. Deploy your PHP service
3. Choose your observability backend
4. Let Odigos handle the rest

Whether you're debugging a monolith or scaling microservices, observability should never be a blocker-and with this release, it isn‚Äôt.
