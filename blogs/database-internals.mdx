In a world where database performance can make or break user experience, traditional monitoring tools are simply no longer enough. They offer only a surface-level look at database internals, leaving critical gaps between client applications and database servers. **Odigos is changing the game** by leveraging advanced eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) technology, providing real-time, unified insights that bridge client and server activities in a single, cohesive trace. This breakthrough delivers unparalleled depth and clarity, empowering teams to pinpoint performance issues and optimize database efficiency like never before.

> Note: These advanced features are exclusive to the Enterprise Edition of Odigos.

## The Power of eBPF: Next-Level Database Monitoring

eBPF technology enables programs to run directly within the Linux kernel, granting unprecedented system-level visibility with minimal overhead. Odigos leverages this power to redefine what’s possible in database monitoring. Here’s a look at how Odigos, powered by eBPF, stacks up against traditional methods:

| **Aspect**                    | **Traditional Monitoring**             | **eBPF with Odigos**                                   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Overhead**                  | Often high with detailed logging       | Minimal, thanks to efficient kernel-level operation    |
| **Flexibility**               | Limited to predefined metrics          | Highly flexible, captures custom events                |
| **Depth of Insight**          | Application-level only                 | Kernel-level insights available                        |
| **Dynamic Updates**           | Often requires restarts                | Can be updated on-the-fly                              |
| **Code Modifications**        | May require code changes or agents     | Non-intrusive, no code changes needed                  |
| **Real-time Visibility**      | Often delayed or batched               | Immediate, real-time insights                          |
| **Client-Server Correlation** | Typically separate, disconnected views | Unified traces connecting client and server activities |

### Odigos: Transforming Database Insight with eBPF

Odigos provides an unparalleled view into database performance and internals by integrating advanced monitoring across every layer, from the client application to the database server. Here’s how Odigos redefines database monitoring and empowers teams with data-driven precision.

### 1. **Query-Level Insights**: Real-Time, Client-Connected Query Analysis

- **Feature**: Real-time SQL query interception with client-side context
- **How it Works**: eBPF probes capture SQL queries at both client and database engine levels
- **What You Gain**:

  - Complete visibility into executed SQL queries linked to the originating client
  - Performance metrics paired with query text and client operations, identifying costly or slow queries
  - Identification of frequent and problematic queries associated with specific client actions

### 2. **Deep Query Execution Tracing**: Analyze Every Stage of Query Processing

- **Feature**: Detailed tracing of query execution pipelines
- **How it Works**: Probes track critical functions at each stage of query execution
- **What You Gain**:
  - Timing breakdowns of query stages (parsing, planning, execution) for pinpointed optimizations
  - End-to-end correlation between queries and execution metrics, revealing bottlenecks

### 3. **Resource Utilization and Lock Management**: Unmatched Precision in Resource Tracking

- **I/O Operations Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of I/O operations to ensure efficient data flow
  - **How it Works**: eBPF tracks I/O-related system calls with full visibility into file and network operations
- **Lock Contention Detection**: Identify and troubleshoot locking issues to prevent resource conflicts
  - **How it Works**: eBPF probes attach to locking functions to detect contention in real time

- **Resource Utilization Tracking**: Understand CPU, memory, and I/O usage for effective resource management
  - **How it Works**: Low-level monitoring reveals the link between operations and resource consumption
