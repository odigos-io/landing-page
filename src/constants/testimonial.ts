  '“eBPF-based instrumentation is clearly the future for observability. It brings composability to the observability stack and a is much faster way to get metrics, logs, and traces to different data platforms and gives us more control over our overall observability strategy. With Odigos we make the lives of our development teams dramatically/so much easier. Odigos integrates seamlessly with our existing stack, sending traces, metrics, and logs straight into Splunk. It’s been a great way to expand observability across our services with almost zero developer overhead.”';
